AIF-NG (Arch Installation Framework, Next Generation) is a means to install Arch Linux (https://www.archlinux.org/) in an unattended and automated fashion. Think of it as something akin to RedHat's Kickstart or Debian's Preseed for Arch Linux.

Be sure to import "aif" rather than importing any submodules directly, as deterministic logic is used to set up virtual names.

See https://aif-ng.io/ for more information about this project.
