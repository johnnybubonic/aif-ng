[preface]
== Preface
=== About the Author
I am a GNU/Linux Systems/Network Administrator/Engineer- I wear a lot of hats. I have a lot of side projects to keep me busy when I’m not working at _${dayjob}_, mostly to assist in other side projects and become more efficient and proficient at those tasks. “Shaving the yak,” footnote:[See http://catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html] indeed.

I got frustrated at the lack of options for installing Arch from a network or automated deployment environment and decided I needed a tool to do that for me.


=== What is AIF-NG?
https://github.com/jdodds/aif[AIF^] (classic) was written entirely in bash, required compilation, wasn't flexible enough, and is obsolete/no longer maintained. So I rewrote it in Python3 and give it a more basic yet flexible structure.

The client (`aifclient.py`) is a single script and gets its configuration from a combination of an XML file and kernel paramaters (which tell it where to find the former and how to access it).

AIF-NG is intended mainly for system administrators, but if you find yourself turning up a lot of Arch Linux installations in other environments, you may find it useful.

=== What it's Not
AIF-NG is not intended to be a complete turnup solution. Instead, it's useful to build up from baremetal and configure a system to a point where you can use another management tool (such as https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible^], https://www.chef.io/chef/[Chef^], https://puppet.com/[Puppet^], https://saltstack.com/[SaltStack^], and  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software#Configuration_management_tools[others^]).

Though if you're really gung-ho about it, I suppose you could use the post-script feature to fully turn up a box.

It is also not a magic bullet. It will not make an Arch Linux installation *easier*, nor is it designed to do that. Don't file bug reports for this. It's designed to make it *faster*. I recommend you follow the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide[manual installation process^] several times first so you're comfortable with the process and understand what's happening behind the scenes. (If you find it too hard to understand, you may instead be interested in https://antergos.com/[Antergos^] instead.)

= Getting Started

== Downloading
If it isn't in your distro's repositories (It *is* in Arch's AUR! Both https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aif/[tagged release^] and https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aif-git/[git master^].), you can still easily get rolling. Simply visit the project's https://git.square-r00t.net/AIF-NG/[source code web interface^] and download a tarball under the *Download* column:

image::fig1.1.png[cgit,align="center"]

If you know the tag of the commit you want, you can use curl:

 curl -sL -o aif.tar.xz https://git.square-r00t.net/AIF-NG/snapshot/AIF-NG-0.01-BETA.tar.xz

or wget:

 wget -O aif.tar.xz https://git.square-r00t.net/AIF-NG/snapshot/AIF-NG-0.01-BETA.tar.xz

You can use `https://git.square-r00t.net/AIF-NG/snapshot/AIF-NG-master.tar.xz` for the URL if you want the latest working version. If you want a snapshot of a specific commit, you can use e.g. `https://git.square-r00t.net/AIF-NG/snapshot/AIF-NG-0e3b4572f9bc460741fe5cd3108b22fad89bfc71.tar.xz` and so on.

Alternatively, you can use https://git-scm.com/[git^]. Git most definitely _should_ be in your distro's repositories.

TIP: If you're new to git and want to learn more, I highly recommend the book https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Pro Git^]. It is available for free download (or online reading).

You can clone via https:

 git clone https://git.square-r00t.net/AIF-NG

or native git protocol:

 git clone git://git.square-r00t.net/aif-ng.git AIF-NG

The git protocol is much faster, but at a cost of lessened security.

NOTE: I also have a mirror at https://github.com/johnnybubonic/aif-ng[GitHub^], but I don't like GitHub very much and since it's a mirror repository, it's possible it will be out of date. For this reason, it's recommended that you use the resources above.

== Prerequisites
This is a list of software you'll need available to use the AIF-NG client.

TIP: Your distro's package manager should have most if not all of these available, so it's unlikely you'll need to install from source.

NOTE: Some versions may be higher than actually needed.


=== Necessary
These are needed for using AIF-NG.

* https://www.python.org/[Python^] (>=3.6)
* http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/sgdisk.html[sgdisk^]
* https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/[parted^]
* https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=arch-install-scripts[arch-install-scripts^] (for `pacstrap`)
** https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_existing_Linux#From_a_host_running_another_Linux_distribution[This^] has some useful methods of installing them in a non-Arch Linux distro.

These are no required Python modules; at least for the client. It uses only the python 3 stdlib library.

=== Optional
While not strictly necessary, these will greatly enhance your AIF-NG usage. I've included some reasons why you might want to install them.

Python modules:

* http://lxml.de/[LXML^]
** Recommended for more complete XML processing, the `aifverify.py` utility, etc.


= Starting an Install
First, `aifclient.py` (`/usr/bin/aifclient` in AUR packages) must be configured to start at boot after networking has initiated in the host environment. This can be done very easily with a https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html[oneshot^] https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd#Writing_unit_files[systemd unit file^].

However, this will do nothing on its own. This is a security measure; you can very easily destroy the host's installation if you attempt to run AIF-NG with an inappropriate configuration. For this reason, AIF-NG will exit if it is not enabled via the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters[kernel commandline/boot parameters^] (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mkinitcpio#HOOKS[mkinitcpio hooks^] may be provided in future updates to the AUR packages to assist in creating more lightweight install environments).

Configure your bootloader to add the following options as necessary:

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Parameter ^|Purpose
^m|aif |This enables AIF-NG; without this, a run will never be initiated - note that `aif` and `aif=True` are the same, and it can be explicitly disabled by setting `aif=False`
^m|aif_url |The URI to your <<writing_an_xml_configuration_file, XML configuration file>> (see <<aif_url, below>>)
^m|aif_auth |(see <<aif_url, below>>)
^m|aif_username |(see <<aif_url, below>>)
^m|aif_password |(see <<aif_url, below>>)
^m|aif_realm |(see <<aif_url, below>>)
|======================

[[aif_url]]
== Some notes on auth and URIs
* `aif_url` can be an HTTP/HTTPS URL, an FTP/FTPS URI, or a `file://` URI. e.g.:
** `aif_url=http://aif.square-r00t.net/aif.xml`
** `aif_url=https://aif.square-r00t.net/aif.xml`
** `aif_url=ftp://ftp.domain.tld/bootstrap/aif.xml`
** `aif_url=ftps://secure.ftp.domain.tld/bootstrap/aif.xml`
** `aif_url=file:///srv/aif/aif.xml`
* If `aif_url` is an HTTP/HTTPS URL, then `aif_user` is the username to use with the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_errors[401^]/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235[RFC 7235] auth (via `aif_auth`).
** If `aif_url` is an FTP/FTPS URI, then `aif_user` will be the FTP user.
** The same behavior applies for `aif_password`.
* If `aif_auth` is `digest`, this is the realm we would use (we attempt to "guess" if it isn’t specified); otherwise it is ignored.

== Debugging
Sometimes it's useful to get a little more information, or to start an installation from within an already-booted environment and you didn't remember (or weren't able to) change the kernel parameters. If this is the case, simple export the `DEBUG` environment variable (it can be set to anything, it doesn't matter) - if this is done, the arguments will be read from /tmp/cmdline instead. e.g.:

 rm -f *
 export DEBUG=true
 cp /proc/cmdline /tmp/.
 chmod 600 /tmp/cmdline
 sed -i -e '1s/$/ aif aif_url=https:\/\/aif.square-r00t.net\/aif.xml/' /tmp/cmdline

It will also write the full configuration (*after* parsing) to `/root/log`.

= Writing an XML Configuration File
I've included a sample `aif.xml` file with the project which is fully functional. However, it's not ideal- namely because it will add my personal SSH pubkeys to your new install, and you probably don't want that. However, it's fairly complete so it should serve as a good example. If you want to see the full set of supported configuration elements, take a look at the most up-to-date https://aif.square-r00t.net/aif.xsd[aif.xsd^]. For explanation's sake, however, we'll go through it here. The directives are referred to in https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_xpath.asp[XPath^] syntax within the documentation text for easier context (but not the titles).

== `<aif>`
The `/aif` element is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_element[root element^]. It serves as a container for all the configuration data. The only http://www.xmlfiles.com/xml/xml_attributes.asp[attributes^] it contains are for formatting and verification of the containing XML.

=== `<storage>`
The `/aif/storage` element contains <<code_disk_code, disk>>, <<code_part_code, disk/part>>, and <<code_mount_code, mount>> elements.

==== `<disk>`
The `/aif/storage/disk` element holds information about disks on the system, and within this element are one (or more) <<code_part_code, part>> elements.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|device |The disk to format (e.g. `/dev/sda`)
^m|diskfmt |https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table[`gpt`^] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record[`bios`^]
|======================

===== `<part>`
The `/aif/storage/disk/part` element holds information on partitioning that it's parent <<code_disk_code, disk>> element should have.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|num |The partition number (positive integer)
^m|start |The amount of the *total disk size* to _start_ the partition at (see <<specialsize, below>>)
^m|size |The amount of the *total disk size* to _end_ the partition at (see <<specialsize, below>>)
^m|fstype |The partition type. Must be in http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/cgdisk-walkthrough.html[gdisk format^] (see <<fstypes, below>>)
|======================

[[specialsize]]
The `start` and `size` attributes can be in the form of:

* A percentage, indicated by a percentage sign (`"10%"`)
* A size, indicated by the abbreviation (`"300K"`, `"30G"`, etc.)
** Accepts *K* (Kilobytes), *M* (Megabytes), *G* (Gigabytes), *T* (Terabytes), or *P* (Petabytes - I know, I know.)
** Can also accept modifiers for this form (`"+500G"`, `"-400M"`)

[[fstypes]]

|======================

==== `<mount>`
The `/aif/storage/mount` element specifies mountpoints for each <<code_disk_code, disk>>'s <<code_part_code, partition>>.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|source |The device to mount
^m|target |Where it should be mounted to in the filesystem (on the host system, not the new installation); if `swap`, it will be handled as swapspace instead
^m|order |The order in which it should be mounted. These should be unique positive integers.
^m|fstype |The filesystem type; usually this is not required but if you need to manually specify the type of filesystem, this will allow you to do it
^m|opts |The mount options; provide the string exactly as it would be provided to mount(8)'s `-o` option
|======================

=== `<network>`
The `/aif/network` element specifies network configuration(s). It contains <<code_iface_code, iface>> ("interface") elements.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|hostname |The hostname of the new installation
|======================

==== `<iface>`
The `/aif/network/iface` element specifies various <<code_network_code, network>> configurations. Currently only ethernet is supported, and only limited support for IPv6 is available (but future improvements/flexible capabilities are planned).

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|device |The interface name (in https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/[Predictable Interface Naming^]) (e.g. `ens3`); can be `auto` (see below)
^m|address |The address to be assigned to the interface (in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing[CIDR^] format); can be `auto` (see below)
^m|netproto |One of `ipv4`, `ipv6`, or `both`
^m|gateway |The gateway address for the interface/protocol pairing; only used if `address` is not `auto`
^m|resolvers |The DNS resolver addresses, if you wish/need to manually specify them; pass as a comma-separated list
|======================

If "auto" is specified for `device`, the system will configure the first (and *only* the first) interface it finds with an active link with the provided address information.

If "auto" is specified for `address`, then DHCP (or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCPv6[DHCPv6], depending on the configuration of `netproto`).

NOTE: Setting `netproto` to "both" is really only useful if "auto" is specified for `address`.

=== `<system>`
The `/aif/system` element is for handling general system configuration. It contains the <<code_users_code, users>>, <<code_user_code, users/user>>, <<code_home_code, users/user/home>>, <<code_xgroup_code, users/user/xgroup>>, and <<code_service_code, service>> elements.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|timezone |The https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time#Time_zone[timezone^] for the installed system (can be independent of the host system)
^m|locale |The https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Locale#Setting_the_system_locale[locale^] of the installed system (e.g. `en_US.UTF-8`)
^m|chrootpath |The path on the host that will serve as the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Change_root[chroot^] path. This should be where your new install's / (root filesystem partition) is mounted at in <<code_mount_code, mounts>>
^m|kbd |The https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Set_the_keyboard_layout[keyboard layout^] (if not US)
|======================

==== `<users>`
The `/aif/system/users` element is used to specify users you wish to create (if any). It contains the <<code_user_code, user>>, <<code_home_code, user/home>>, and <<code_xgroup_code, user/xgroup>> elements.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|rootpass |A properly hashed-and-salted password. See <<passwordhashes, below>>
|======================

[[passwordhashes]]
NOTE: To generate a proper hashed/salted password, you may want to reference https://bdisk.square-r00t.net/#generating_a_password_salt_hash[this section^] from https://bdisk.square-r00t.net/[BDisk^]'s user manual (another project of mine). You can use https://git.square-r00t.net/BDisk/tree/extra/bin/hashgen.py[this python script^] to generate one. If you specify an empty string, the password will be BLANK (i.e. you can log in with just the username). This is very insecure. If you specify a `!` instead of a salted hash, TTY login will be disabled (though it will still be possible to log in via other means such as SSH pubkey auth - assuming you configure it beforehand. This has some *added* security benefits.

===== `<user>`
The `/aif/system/users/user` element specifies user(s) to create. It contains <<code_xgroup_code, xgroup>> and <<code_home_code, home>> elements.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|name |The username/login name
^m|sudo |If (full) sudo access should be granted to this user (boolean; must be one of `1`/`true` or `0`/`false`)
^m|password |The salted/hashed password (see <<passwordhashes, above>>)
^m|comment |A comment (typically, the user's real/full name)
^m|uid |The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier[UID^] of the user; if specified, must be a positive integer
^m|group |The primary group of the user (the default is to create a new group named after that user)
^m|gid |The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier[GID^] to use for the primary group; must be a positive integer
|======================

====== `<xgroup>`
The `/aif/system/users/user/xgroup` elements specifies one (or more) "eXtra groups" (i.e. non-primary) that AIF-NG should add the user to.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|name |The group name
^m|create |If the group should be created (boolean; must be one of `1`/`true` or `0`/`false`)
^m|gid |The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier[GID^] to use (if creating); must be a positive integer and not be taken by an existing group
|======================

====== `<home>`
The `/aif/system/users/user/home` element contains information for a <<code_user_code, user>>'s home directory. It can be only specified once per user, but it is optional.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|path |The path for the home directory; useful if you don't want it to be /home/<username>
^m|create |If the home directory should be created (boolean; must be one of `1`/`true` or `0`/`false`)
|======================

==== `<service>`
The `/aif/system/service` element holds information about services that should explicitly be enabled/disabled on boot.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|name |The service name. It can be shortform (`sshd`) or long form (`git-daemon.socket`); if the shortform is provided, ".service" is assumed
^m|status |A boolean that specifies if the service should be enabled (`1`/`true`) or disabled (`0`/`false`)
|======================

=== `<pacman>`
The `/aif/pacman` element contains the <<code_repos_code, repos>>, <<code_repo_code, repos/repo>>, <<code_mirrorlist_code, mirrorlist>>, <<code_mirror_code, mirrorlist/mirror>>, <<code_software_code, software>>, <<code_package_code, software/packages>>, and <<code_command_code, command>> elements.

==== `<command>`
NOTE: This is currently kind of useless. I need to implement a pre-package-installation <<code_scripts_code, hook script>> first. I promise it's coming.

If you configured an alternate package utility, you can specify the command here. Note that it should be configured/called with necessary options to avoid the necessity of user involvement (since that's the entire point of AIF-NG).

==== `<repos>`
The `/aif/pacman/repos` element contains one (or more) <<code_repo_code, repo>> element(s).

===== `<repo>`
The `/aif/pacman/repos/repo` elements specify information for configuring the installed system's /etc/pacman.conf (specifically, the repositories).

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|name |The name of the repository
^m|enabled |A boolean that specifies if the repository should be enabled (`1`/`true`) or disabled (`0`/`false`)
^m|siglevel |The https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Package_security[siglevel^] of the repository (e.g. `Optional TrustedOnly`); can be `default` (in which the pacman.conf default siglevel will be used)
^m|mirror |The URI for the https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Repositories_and_mirrors[mirror^]; if it begins with `file://`, we will use it as an `Include =` instead of a `Server =` (make sure it is a full/absolute path and it exists on the newly installed system)
|======================

===== `<mirrorlist>`
The `/aif/pacman/mirrorlist` element contains elements that should be in `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`. It is optional; if it isn't specified, the default distributed mirrorlist will be used instead.

====== `<mirror>`
The `/aif/pacman/mirrorlist/mirror` elements are <<code_mirrorlist_code, mirrorlist>> entries.

===== `<software>`
The `/aif/pacman/software` element contains one (or more) <<code_package_code, package>> element(s) that describe software to install. It is optional.

====== `<package>`
The `/aif/pacman/software/package` element holds information about software to be installed.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|name |The name of the package (e.g. `openssh`)
^m|repo |Optional, but you can specify which repository to install the package from (in the case of multiple repositories providing the same package)
|======================

=== `<bootloader>`
The `/aif/bootloader` element specifies a https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Boot_loader[bootloader^] to install.

[options="header"]

^m|target |This should be the absolute path (from within the newly installed system) to your https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_System_Partition[ESP^] (if `efi` is true); otherwise the disk/partition to install the bootloader to (if you're using BIOS mode)
|======================

=== `<scripts>`
The `/aif/scripts` element contains one or more <<code_script_code, script>> elements.

==== `<script>`
The `/aif/scripts/script` elements specify scripts to be run at different stages during the install process. This is useful if you need to set up SSH pubkey authentication, for example, or configure https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/RAID[mdadm^] so you can use that as a <<code_disk_code, disk>>.

[options="header"]
|======================
^|Attribute ^|Value
^m|uri |The URI to the script; can be an HTTP/HTTPS reference, an FTP/FTPS reference, or a local file reference (`file:///path/to/file`).
^m|order |A unique positive integer used to order the scripts during the run; note that e.g. pre- and post-scripts are executed at different points, so you can use the same `order` as long as it's in different execution points
^m|authtype |Same behavior as <<starting_an_install, `aif_auth`>> but for fetching this script (see also <<aif_url, further notes>> on this)
^m|user |Same behavior as <<starting_an_install, `aif_user`>> but for fetching this script (see also <<aif_url, further notes>> on this)
^m|password |Same behavior as <<starting_an_install, `aif_password`>> but for fetching this script (see also <<aif_url, further notes>> on this)
^m|realm |Same behavior as <<starting_an_install, `aif_realm`>> but for fetching this script (see also <<aif_url, further notes>> on this)
^m|bootstrap |A boolean; if `1`/`true` then we will run this script before even formatting <<code_disk_code, disks>>; otherwise if it's `0`/`false` then we would run it *inside* the chroot environment as the very last thing
|======================

NOTE: The `bootstrap` attribute is subject to change to something more flexible to allow more flexibility in when the scripts are executed. Expect this to happen soon, so be aware.
