- config layout
-- need to apply defaults and annotate/document

find out where to run aif-pre.sh (runs on host) (rename to aif-pre.script)
and get a way to insert that and aif-post(.script) from the kernel params, etc.
remember to uncomment the functions in main() when ready to test

- use sgdisk? scripting (generated by python) for disk partitioning (part types listed at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/walkthrough.html )
-- actually, might want to use parted --script instead? then we can do percentages. https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html

- add mkfs-ing
- how to support mdadm, lvm?

-support serverside "autoconfig"- a mechanism to let servers automatically generate xml build configs. e.g.:
  kernel ... aif_url="https://build.domain.tld/aif-ng.php" auto=yes
would yield the *client* sending info via URL params, e.g.
  https://build.domain.tld/aif-ng.php?disk[]=sda&disk[]=sdb&disk[sda]=300GB&disk[sdb]=500GB
? something like that.
